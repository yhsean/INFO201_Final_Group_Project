## Finding Data

Our first piece of data was downloaded from Data.gov, the governments public database for data of all sorts. It was created by the Environmental protection agency who created this walkability index based on a previous data product of theirs, the Smart Location Database. The Walkability Index contains information on every census block in the United States, meaning it covers every inch of the country. Using many different defining characteristics and statistics on the built environment, each census block is given a rating or a score. This dataset has 220740 rows and 117 columns, most of which will be sorted out as we progress towards the final result.

Our second piece of data was also downloaded from Data.gov. It is research published by the GIS department in Lake County, Illinois and contains statistics on the obesity rates of each US state. The data was generated by the Center for Disease Control in a 2015 survey. The dataset includes 5 features for 52 rows of observations.
